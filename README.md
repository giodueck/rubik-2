# Rubik 2
A new iteration of a Rubik's cube solver, this time with a cube built on cubies, individual unit cubes with colored faces, instead of my previous approach of just colored faces.

This allows the cube to take any XxYxZ dimension, not just 3x3x3.

Designed to be usable with various solvers, primarily with bidirectional search but open for experimentation.
